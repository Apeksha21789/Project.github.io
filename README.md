Level -1 

This level focuses on foundational data analysis tasks to understand restaurant trends. The following analyses were performed:

Top Cuisines: Identified the three most common cuisines and calculated their restaurant distribution percentages.

City Analysis: Found the city with the most restaurants and calculated average ratings per city.

Price Range Distribution: Created a bar chart showing the distribution of restaurants across price categories and calculated the percentage in each.

Online Delivery Impact: Determined the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery and compared their average ratings with those that don't.

These tasks helped to build core skills in data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, and visualization using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
